## üìÅ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo containing two separate packages:

  * `./client`: The Next.js frontend application. This is what the public sees and what the admin uses to manage content.
  * `./server`: The Node.js, Express, and Prisma backend. This serves the REST API that the client consumes.
